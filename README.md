# STM32_Platform

The STM32 platform integrates a MCU, a BLE transmitter(BlueNRG), and several sensors. All the chips are manufactured by STMicroelectronics.

This repository includes a comprehensive SDK, together with various software resources like drivers, middlewares, and application demos for further developments.

##Quick Start

1. Choose Demo project  
Learn demos under `/product` folder, select and open one project in Keil.  

2. Learn how to Compile   
Cannon board has two versions, select the right one in Keil compile option.  
Make sure all the header files are included.

3. Learn how to Download firmware  
Connect Cannon to computer via J-Link or ST-LINK.   
Download firmware to Cannon.

4. Work with BLE APP  
A debugger APP (`/tools/JumaBleHelper.apk`) is offered to facilitate BLE development. It can be installed and run on Android machine to transmit BLE raw data to/from Cannon.  
The iOS version can be downloaded in AppStore as well.
